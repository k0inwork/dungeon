ideas for now
1) make a mock data for multilayer dungeon
like top level is grid dungeon with nothing
then we have 3 entrances to 3 roguelikes
but those are "links"
so actually we have 3 platformer links - they lead to 3 roguelikes - their exits lead back to top dungeon

2) extend AJS to support complex control structures (like more complex expression in for and while cycles)
